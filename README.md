# Digital Literacy

This repository contains curricula, syllabi and classroom activities of an ongoing digital literacy course for **low-educated asylum seekers and migrants** who recently arrived in Rovereto, a city in Italy. 

The course is designed according to **non-formal education principles.**

Various editions of the course have been carried out since 2016, but this is the first time we, the teachers, try to **systematise and share** the materials we use.

Most of the content is in Italian as it is the teaching language. English may follow at some point :relaxed:

This project will soon be part of the upcoming [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/meet-our-next-cohort-of-open-leaders-ebc8dadb2e53) program. For info, contact [@martina_puppi](https://twitter.com/martina_puppi)
